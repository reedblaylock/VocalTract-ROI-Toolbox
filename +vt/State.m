	% When a property is a struct, any change to a field of that property will
	% trigger a PostSet event for the property.
	% When a property is an object, changes to that object will not trigger a
	% PostSet event. In this case, a PostSet event is only triggered when a new
	% object (either a new instance or a new class) is assigned to the property.
