TODO

- Use MATLAB class naming conventions (camelCase?)
UPDATE: Revisit this later: http://www.datatool.com/downloads/MatlabStyle2%20book.pdf

- Extract the input-parsing from the subclass constructors. There's a lot of
repetition from class to class, and it would be easy to forget how to do
optional actions from one class to another...
UPDATE: It's annoying, but it makes the most sense to repeat the inputParser 
stuff in every file. If you were really fastidious about input parsing (which 
you're trying to be), then every function could mean additional layers of input
parsing; and, with each successive layer, it's harder to remember what you were 
trying to do in the first place.
But, maybe you just haven't thought of the right approach yet.

- Make a real application! Start by loading videos/VocalTract objects/VocalTract
object file strings and displaying the frame on the screen. Add a slider so you 
can go back and forth faster (and try to get the screen to update as the slider 
moves). http://undocumentedmatlab.com/blog/continuous-slider-callback

== LOAD TEST ==
1. Load a file from the menu --DONE
2. Over-load the current file with another --DONE
3. Load a file from runGui

- Display video with VideoReader, but do analysis with the matrix? Depends what it can get you...

- Implement shortcut keystrokes soon; if you can implement those, you should be able to issue actions from anywhere

- Look into the Interruptible property for figures

*********************************ERROR MANAGER**********************************
You're going to have to use a bunch of try/catch blocks

Your core classes all inherit from vt.Logger (or maybe vt.Root)
==vt.Logger/Root==
Properties:
- log = vt.Log();
==================
This way, in every class, you can do something like...
try
	% broken code
catch exception {MException} % all MATLAB errors are MExceptions under the hood
	this.log.exception(exception)
end

When an exception occurs, you want it to appear in a few places:
- The error log file (in which information older than 30 days [or however long, 
  specified in the preferences] gets dumped to make room for new errors)
- A user-friendly notification bar at the bottom of the GUI, which changes 
  colors depending on the message type/content
- The MATLAB console, in debug mode

It would be nice to define some error behavior to minimize the likelihood of the
program crashing or becoming unresponsive.
- Execution stops (this might actually be easier with an event-based system, 
  because the events will just stop firing. Puts you in a sticky position if the
  most recent event opened a new window or something.
- Interface reverts to a previous state (there's a big risk of accidentally 
  reverting too far back, but it would be a nice way to keep the program running
  smoothly after errors)
  (http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/ImplementingUndoHistory.html)
- Ask user what they want to do

**********************************ACTION PLAN***********************************
Every action is a vt.Action object
== vt.Action ==
Properties:
- data (optional)
Events:
- {the action name}
Methods:
- dispatch(this)
===============
== vt.ActionDispatcher ==
Properties: (Abstract=true)
- action {an Action instance}
=========================
Actions are heard either by an ActionListener or by a StateSetter (aka vt.Reducer)
You probably don't want an action heard by *both*, though...
Maybe there are two classes of Action: StateSetting and non-StateSetting?

% When registering shortcuts...
switch(keyStroke)
	case 'Ctrl+L'
		action = LoadAction();
		action.dispatch();
	case 'rightarrow'
		action = IncrementAction(1);
		action.dispatch();
	case 'Shift+rightarrow'
		action = IncrementAction(2);
		action.dispatch();
	otherwise
		% key stroke is invalid
end

% Example ActionDispatcher...
classdef LoadAviMenuItem < vt.MenuItem & vt.ActionDispatcher
	properties
		action = LoadAction('avi');
	end
	
	methods
		function this = LoadAviMenuItem(this, ...)
			...
			this@vt.MenuItem(...)
			this@vt.ActionDispatcher()
		end
	end
end

Unresolved issues:
- Not sure if the whole "with data"/"without data" thing is still a problem, or 
  if making the actions classes avoids that, since it doesn't have to be 
  specified in the component anymore
- Registering the event listeners can't be avoided. How do you register all the 
  actions without calling their registration from the class? Do you need to?









It looks like some of the GUI components--at the very least, the frame--need to 
know what settings are currently active. For instance, when a point is clicked 
while editing/adding regions, the frame needs to know whether to add an origin 
rectangle and/or border lines based on whether two different checkboxes are 
checked. It has to calculate the placement of borders based on a radius/size 
setting, and may even have to get its color from a different button.

1. Each of these parameters could be abstracted to a class, where all the 
   information is shared
2. The frame doesn't have to be responsible for drawing, though it seems like
   maybe it should?
3. Should the changes be passed through Action.Listener, or a new listener, or 
   no listener?






NEXT
- Figure out how to show the vertical current frame number line on the timeseries
- Make lines and rectangles clickable [you can addlistener(handleArray, ...) all the objects you get with handleArray = findall(figure/axes?, 'Tag', region.id)]
- Exporting basically works, but make sure mview isn't over-filtering
- Fix the button group (see vt.Component.FrameType). Right now, it doesn't register as a valid handle in vt.State.Listener, so state changes don't trigger an update --DONE

SOON
- Refactor
- Comment (you're probably about to hit your working memory breaking point)
- Make sure garbage collection is doing its job. You've been getting a lot of crashes and no-space messages
  UPDATE: From experience, it seems you definitely can be left with a bunch of left-over or half-deleted objects. Explicitly calling delete() seems to do the trick, when you need it.
- Set up a preferences system so that all the defaults are uniform
- Add color box next to the set color button so you can see the current color
- Notifications should disappear on the next action (maybe put that in vt.Action.Listener or vt.Reducer before they redirect to their usual functions)
- Add midline stuff

BEFORE DISTRIBUTION TO TESTERS
- Provide set/get support for <=2014a
